Code Clash #12 - One Up! (addone.py)


Author: Paul Thai

Difficulty Level: 6/10

Background: Do you know how to add? Good! I have just the question for you! 
Most people know how to add by one, but can you add by one in this problem???

Prompt: Given an array, add one to the ones column!

Constraints: You cannot map/join the list into a single number, add one, and then turn it back into a list. 
That's cheating (because I have done it before...) so you must modify the list itself. Be careful of place values! 

Test Cases:
a = [1, 2, 3]; output = [1, 2, 4]
a = [9]; output = [1,0]
a = [1, 4, 5, 9]; output = [1]
